[Back end for pyzlnar.com]

== Introduction

This is the back end repo for link:https://pyzlnar.com[pyzlnar.com] +
The backend is running on a Rails app (API mode) with PSQL.

Nothing too fancy to be honest, and maybe even a bit lackluster considering I'm
supposed to be a backend guy, but tool for the job, so I guess this does for my
small API for now. :)

== Installation

=== Requirements

You will need the following installed to be able to run the back end:

* git +
  Should go without saying. Get yourself git
  link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[installed].
* ruby 2.4.0 +
  I kind of regret not using 2.3.X because all the frozen string warnings. I
  recommend you install it via link:https://rvm.io/rvm/install[rvm] or
  link:https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation[rbenv].
* PostgreSQL 9.6.1 +
  Always a nightmare to setup, but it's amazing to use. General instructions can
  be found link:https://www.postgresql.org/download/[here].
* Memcached (Optional) +
  User for simple caching, but won't have that much of an effect if you don't
  install it other than slower responses. Install instructions can be found
  link:https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Install[here]. +

=== Source Code

Clone the repo into your machine, and then change to the directory before you
run anything else.

[source, bash]
----
# Create a root directory first if you haven't already.
# The directory structure is not needed, but I like working this way.
$ mkdir pyzlnar

# Clone the repo into front
$ git clone git@github.com:pyzlnar/pyzlnar-back.git pyzlnar/back

# Change to back directory
$ cd pyzlnar/back
----

With the front repo, directories will look like this.

[source, bash]
----
$ tree pyzlnar/ -L 1
pyzlnar/
├── back
└── front
----

=== Dependencies

Now to install all the dependencies. First you need to install bundler(v1.14.3+)

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
----

After that, you simply need to install with bundler!

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install

# Or simply
$ bundle
----

You might find yourself that the `pg` gem is being uncooperative. If that's the
case follow the output instructions or google around on how to correctly setup
the gem and retry until you've succesfuly installed all the gems.

The project uses `rails 5.0.1` as of right now in case you're wondering.

=== Initial Setup

Copy the secrets example into the actual secrets files. Edit the new file
`secrets.yml` with your own secrets if needed to.

[source,bash]
----
$ cp config/secrets.example.yml config/secrets.yml
----

Copy the database example into the actual database files. Edit the new file
`database.yml` with your own database configuration.

[source,bash]
----
$ cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
----

Create, migrate and seed the database.

[source,bash]
----
$ rake db:setup
----

If you find yourself with problems creating the database (lol postgres), the
most common errors are not having the correct username/password in the database
config file (`config/database.yml`), not setting the postgres role correctly,
and not setting up the correct database template.

== Running

After all that one time setup, running is actually fairly easy!

[source,bash]
----
# This will run the server in localhost:3000
$ rails s
----

NOTE: If you didn't install memcached, consider commenting out the `cache_store`
setting in `config/environments/development.rb` before running the server.

== Code Integrity

=== Tests

Truth to be told running the tests is very easy, but since I'm using ruby
`2.4.0`, a lot of deprecation warning appear before the tests and it's quite
annoying. To supress those warnings, run the tests like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ RUBYOPT="-W0" rspec spec/
----

=== Lint

I use rubocop to eliminate any smells from the code. To run it just use:

[source,bash]
----
$ rubocop
----

== TODO

Small list of features that may be coming in the future.

* Auth & Auth
* Missing CRUD actions for resources
* Use message pack instead of json
* Use a docker image for ease of installation
