    short:      My first anime blog.
    description: >
      As far as I remember this was not only my first anime blog, it was also my first blog
      too. Spawning for a bit less than a year I wrote a review of every anime I watched in a very
      ordered and formatted way. This strictness ended up burning me up and I ended up not wanting
      to write anymore at some point.
      Even though every anime blog I've written in are now dead I still feel the need to write anime
      reviews now and then. Maybe one day I'll be able to find my own style and stick with it.

    short:      The second (mostly) anime blog
    description: >
      Two years after the dead of my first blog I was presented with the opportunity of being a
      collaborator on a Spanish blog named "El Ultimo Pocky". Writing about a post per week I did
      end up staying there for a bit longer than in "Sleep Deprived". The problem with writing
      frequently and consistently however is that you run out of steam eventually, and even my
      colleagues slowly stopped writing.
      Eventually the owner decided to can the project and leave it behind. I have a copy of all the
      posts I wrote as I had to submit them for revision before the post went live, but I don't
      think I'll make those publicly available again.

    short:      My longest running project, and favorite hobby.
    description: >
      This is the project I'm the proudest about. You see, back in the day it was actually hard to
      come around good gifs. Being the anime junkie I am, I wanted to get gifs of very specific
      scenes, and it was very hard to find them. What do you do if you don't find what you want?
      You make them yourself. Making gifs eventually became a hobby of mine and at a point I decided
      to create a site where I would see an anime show, and gif the crap out of it.
      Animegifs was created with that in mind and I enjoyed the experience until the end. The main
      reason of why this was stalled is actually because I had a hard time making gifs out of
      Watamote, and because the new format webm took over the old and inefficient gif.
      Despite that I still hope to one day eventually come back and port my old gifs to the new
      format. We'll see.

    short:      A TF2 server I owned, for the fun times.
    description: >
      I was not sure whether to add this here or not, but might as well since it lived for so long.
      I used to play a lot of TF2 in a server called "Mech-anic's House of Fatalities". I actually
      was an admin there for a couple of years. Eventually the guy in charge could not affort paying
      the bills so I decided to rent my own server so the community could still play there.
      With the years the community went from small to none which is why I decided to close down the
      server in favor of this site you're browsing on.

    short:      A ruby-gem that helps to write commands in ruby.
    description: >
      In case you don't know, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer. I find Ruby to be a very beautiful
      language, so as my knowledge on it grew I wanted to write my own set of gems. AyeCommander is
      the first (and so far) only gem I've written.
      The idea was to write a better version of the Interactor gem so that we could have cleaner
      commands at work. After a couple of weeks I released a (buggy) version 1.0.0 which was quickly
      fixed next day as 1.0.1. I still have plans for a couple more gems and to improve some aspects
      I don't like of AyeCommander in the future, so feel free to leave feedback in the repo if you
      want to!

    short:      My own site.
    description: >
      Well you're here! As my killed my TF2 server I decided that I was gonna use the money I used
      to rent it on my own site. And that's what I did. Having my own domain, public IP and VPS has
      been a wet dream since highschool, and the fact that I now have my own playground makes me
      very very happy. If you want to know more about the site go to the about section.

    short:       Developer at Anime-Planet.
    description: >
      Who would have guessed that after almost ten years of using Anime-Planet a series of random
      events would lead to me being invited as being a developer for the site? Hah.
      Not sure what else needs to be said, I am truly grateful and happy for the opportunity and I
      do my best to help out a site that I really like. Yeah, even if it built in a programming
      language that I personally dislike.
