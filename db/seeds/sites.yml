      It may not be my first blog, but it is the oldest one that still somehow survives.
      Been an casual blogger since 2009. While I just really write every so often I hope to change
      that tendency soon. Writing always makes me happy after all.

      Contains personal programming projects. Every now and then I feel the need to learn a new
      technology or just to code something that seems fun. While not all ideas end up
      actually being created, when they do the source code will most likely end up here. That's
      a bit sad considering there's not that much in there. Oh well.

      A couple of years ago you could read very often that miniblogging killed blogging. I guess
      those statements were right for the most part. Do not expect sanity in my twitter account;
      in fact expect a lot of anime girls, cyriak and similar.

      While I take pride on the quantity of anime I've seen I cannot deny that most of my free time
      actually goes to gaming instead. Steam is probably a part of about every PC gamer nowadays so
      if you feel like it you can hang over my profile. If you want to add me let me know first
      though, I normally ignore friend requests since I assume they're just bots or scammers.

      Why not MyAnimeList? Well I heard about Anime-Planet first... also I like their UI way better.
      You can see here the insane quantity of anime I've seen over the years, and when I say insane
      quantities I'm not overselling myself.

      Back when I was a student I used to watch all of my anime via illegal stream sites. There was
      no alternative after all. Nowadays Crunchyroll is my preferred streaming site and I do have a
      premium subscription there, so I guess that's that.

      Yeah... This was a thing I used... a bit. Back in highschool I had several friends that used
      it so I eventually ended up with an account. I do like music but definitely not on the same
      level as my friends did so I eventually stopped using the site. If you're just curious on what
      kind of music I like... anything with cute voices, beats, metal or a combination of those.

      Ah man, newgrounds. Back when I had no money to buy games but I still loved playing them I
      used to frequent this site a lot. While flash games don't have the best reputation nowadays I
      can still recall several that I just loved to dead. Spewer, No time to explain, Dead dice
      overdose, Kitten cannon just to name some. Definitely my origins as a PC gamer can be found
      here.

      I do indeed have a youtube channel. Mostly expect minor game achievements and one or other
      video on past projects I had.

      I like taking photos. I have absolutely no idea of the theory behind it, nor do I feel I have
      enough interest to take the time to learn it. When I see an opportunity for what I think will
      be a good picture I go for it and that's about it. You're gonna see a lot of those in here.
